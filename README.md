# wallet-login-backend

Backend for allowing users to login using their Dapp wallet credentials.

## How it works

The user is prompted to login via their wallet provider (e.g. Metamask) by signing a code into a message with their public and private keys. The signature is verified when the user is logged in using the code and public key. A user account is created and a JWT is provided to the logged in user for that address.
